As an attachment here you will find a pre-built Spotify-like html page.

 

The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the provided API instead of having them hardcoded on the page.

Fill the content on the page (in the proper sections) with the data from this api calls by creating the right amount of Bootstrap Cards :

https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q=metallica

https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q=queen

Make sure the API gets called during page load.

Add a list albums button. When pressed, displays a list of all the album titles on the page (try to make it appear in a modal)
Add a count unique button. When pressed, shows a log in the console with the number of unique albums in the page
tip: use Template Literals to create Card html code
